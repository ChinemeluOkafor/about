**Check out my personal website [here](https://www.chinemeluokafor.com/)!**

I am a third-year Harvard PhD candidate, Graduate Prize Fellow, Karl Deutsch Fellow, and 2024-25 Weatherhead Center Graduate Student Associate. My research lies at the intersection of political economy, development economics, and economic history. Specifically, I quantitatively explore the social, cultural, and institutional channels through which colonial-era policies persist and shape contemporary economic and political development outcomes in Nigeria. 

In 2023 I was 1 of 30 recipients of a [Forbes 30 under 30 North America award in education](https://www.forbes.com/profile/chinemelu-okafor/?sh=2b41c5928d20https://www.forbes.com/profile/chinemelu-okafor/?sh=2b41c5928d20) for my work as the founder and president of the [Research in Color Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Research_in_Color_Foundation) — a 501c(3) non-profit organization dedicated to increasing the representation and retention of historically excluded scholars in economics through mentorship and financial support. In the past, I have worked with institutions such as the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation, and the United Nations, among others. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Economics and International Studies from the University of Michigan and a Master’s degree in Applied Economics from George Washington University. For the 2023-24 school year, I was on leave from my PhD program and working as a Staff Economist with the White House Council of Economics Advisers on topics related to international economics and trade.
